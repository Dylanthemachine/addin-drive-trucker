# addin-drive-trucker

This is a sample add-in created for Geotab Connect 2018 conference presentation: Building an Add-In That Leverages data.geotab.com

There are two parts to the sample:

- Truck parking API that searches the [data.geotab.com](data.geotab.com) dataset of truck parking locations
- Geotab Drive add-in that uses the truck parking API to display truck parking locations
